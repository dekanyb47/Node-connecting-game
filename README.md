# Node-connecting-game
Simple game where the objective is to connect all the nodes without any of the obstacles or the lines intersecting. The program is **incomplete**, but its foundations are finished.

## Controls:
**Left click** to select nodes
**Right click** to clear all inputs made during the level.
**F** to toggle fullscreen mode

## Notes:
- The game uses the console window to display messages.
- It only has 4 levels as of now
- I originally wrote the code for this program during late-2024.

## Ideas if I continue development:
- Make it so that messages are displayed in the program
- Make a proper UI
- Design more levels
- Add more types of objects (e.g. moving obstacles)
