# Node-connecting-game
Simple game where the objective is to connect all the nodes without any of the obstacles or the lines intersecting. The program is **incomplete**, but its foundations are finished.

## Controls:
**Left click** to select nodes\n
**Right click** to clear all inputs made during the level.\n
**F** to toggle fullscreen mode

## Features:
- Basic controls for selection and fullscreen.  
- Console feedback for gameplay messages.

## Current State  
- 4 playable levels  
- Originally written in late-2024
- Written fully in python

## Future Ideas:
- Make it so that messages are displayed in the program
- Make a proper UI
- Design more levels
- Add more types of objects (e.g. moving obstacles)
